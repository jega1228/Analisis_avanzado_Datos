    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- 50% Report with all the details of the solution, the analysis and the conclusions. The report cannot exceed 10 pages, must be send in PDF format and must be self-contained.\n",
    "- 50% Performance in the Kaggle competition (The grade for each group will be proportional to the ranking it occupies in the competition. The group in the first place will obtain 5 points, for each position below, 0.25 points will be subtracted, that is: first place: 5 points, second: 4.75 points, third place: 4.50 points ... eleventh place: 2.50 points, twelfth place: 2.25 points).\n",

    "- The project must be carried out in the groups assigned.\n",
    "- Use clear and rigorous procedures.\n",
    "- The delivery of the project is on August 1st, 2021, 11:59 pm, through Bloque Neón.\n",
    "- No projects will be received after the delivery time or by any other means than the one established.\n",
